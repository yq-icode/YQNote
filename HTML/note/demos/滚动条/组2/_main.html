        <h3>Responsive Image Gallery with Thumbnail Carousel</h3>
        A tutorial on how to create a responsive image gallery with a thumbnail carousel using Elastislide. Inspired by Twitter&#39;s &quot;user gallery&quot; and upon a request to show an integration of Elastislide, we want to implement a responsive gallery that adapts to the view-port width. The gallery will have a view switch that allows to view it with the thumbnail carousel or without. We&#39;ll also add the possibility to navigate with the keyboard.

        <h3>Elastislide - A Responsive jQuery Carousel Plugin</h3>
        With the responsive awakening in web design it becomes important to not only take care of the visual part of a website but also of the functionality. Elastislide is a responsive jQuery carousel that will adapt its size and its behavior in order to work on any screen size. Inserting the carousels structure into a container with a fluid width will also make the carousel fluid.

        <h3>Slicebox - A fresh 3D image slider with graceful fallback</h3>
        With the CSS3 3D transformations we can create some neat effects by transforming elements in three-dimensional space. Slicebox makes use of the 3D transforms properties and allows different kind of effects. The main idea is to create three-dimensional image slices that will rotate and reveal the next image as another side of the 3d object. In case the browser does not support 3D transformations, a simple slider will be used as fallback.

        <h3>Automatic Image Montage with jQuery</h3>
        Arranging images in a montage like fashion can be a challenging task when considering certain constraints, like the window size when using fullscreen, the right image number to fill all the available space or also the size of the images in use. With the following script you can automatically create a montage, either for a liquid container or a fixed size container (including fullscreen), with the option to fill all the gaps.
